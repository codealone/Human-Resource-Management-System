# Human-Resource-Management-System

This Project was done during the completion of course of Object-Oriented Programming with JAVA in my 4th semester.

The basic idea of the project is to calculate, maintain and optimize the use of human resources in an company.So, for each employee we maintain some information in the database (in this case MySQL here) and we apply the optimization algorithm based on the need of the company and we get the desired solution.

This Project used JAVA , Java Swings and MySQL and followed the MVC model.
